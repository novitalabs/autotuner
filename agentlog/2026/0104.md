<summary>GPU Type Feature Implementation</summary>

**API Endpoint - `/api/workers/gpu-types`**
- Returns available GPU types from registered workers
- Supports `deployment_mode` query parameter for filtering
- Response includes both available GPUs (with availability counts) and pre-defined candidates list

**GPU Candidates List Updated**
- Added Blackwell series: B100, B200, B300, GB200
- Added: H200, H20, Ada, L40S
- Removed: V series, RTX x080 series

**Frontend GPU Type Dropdown**
- Changed GPU Type field from text input to select dropdown
- Displays availability status with checkmarks and worker counts
- Unavailable GPUs shown but disabled to indicate missing availability
- Dropdown refetches when deployment mode changes

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed FastAPI route ordering: moved static route `/gpu-types` before dynamic route `/{worker_id}` in workers.py to prevent incorrect route matching
- Fixed React hooks initialization error ("Cannot access 'deploymentMode' before initialization") by moving useQuery for GPU types after useState for deploymentMode in NewTask.tsx

**Files Modified**
- `src/web/routes/workers.py` - Added GPU types endpoint
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added getGpuTypes method
- `frontend/src/pages/NewTask.tsx` - Updated GPU type field to dropdown, fixed hooks initialization order
