## Worker Restore Improvements

Enhanced the worker deployment/restore system with three major improvements:

### 1. Auto SSH Key Configuration (`setup_ssh_key_for_manager()`)
- Automatically generates SSH key on remote worker if not present
- Adds remote worker's public key to manager's authorized_keys
- Verifies SSH connectivity from worker to manager
- Enables SSH tunnel for Redis access without manual key setup

### 2. Offline venv Sync (`sync_venv_offline()`)
- Syncs local venv's site-packages to remote via rsync/tar
- Bypasses pip install when network is unreachable
- Auto-fallback when online install fails due to network issues
- Fixes venv bin scripts for correct Python path

### 3. Intelligent Error Suggestions (`get_deployment_error_suggestion()`)
- Provides context-specific fix suggestions for common errors
- Handles: SSH key issues, Redis localhost, network unreachable, module not found, project not found, venv issues, timeouts
- Added `suggestion` field to `DeploymentResult` and API response schema

## Files Modified
- `src/web/services/worker_service.py` - Added 3 new helper functions, updated `start_remote_worker()` to use them
- `src/web/schemas/worker.py` - Added `suggestion` field to `WorkerSlotRestoreResponse`
- `src/web/routes/workers.py` - Pass suggestion field through to response

## Testing Status
- Previous session tested worker slots: 196.2, 196.3, bj-7.67, bj-8.71
- 196.2 had SSH key authentication issues (now auto-handled)
- 196.3 had network unreachable issues (now has offline fallback)
- bj-7.67 and bj-8.71 successfully running in OME mode with 32 GPUs each
