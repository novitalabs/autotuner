> Enhance the TaskResults.tsx component with metric selection, experiment pinning, and multi-experiment scatter plot comparison

<details>
<summary>Enhanced TaskResults.tsx with advanced visualization and interaction features</summary>

**Experiment Metrics Bar Chart:**
- Added metric selection dropdown to dynamically display different metrics (objective_score, mean_total_throughput, etc.)
- Implemented click-to-pin functionality for individual experiments
- Color-coded bars: Green (best experiment), Purple (pinned experiment), Blue (normal)
- Experiment labels show ⭐ for best and 📌 for pinned indicators
- Metric dropdown limited to max-width of 160px for UI consistency

**Performance Metrics - Sub-Rounds Scatter Chart:**
- Refactored to simultaneously display data from three experiments:
  - Best experiment (green dots) - automatically highlighted
  - Hovered experiment (blue dots) - dynamically switches when hovering bar chart
  - Pinned experiment (purple dots) - user-selected via click-to-pin
- Added pinnedExperimentData useMemo hook for efficient data management
- Updated legend to show all active experiments with round counts
- Implemented unpin button (×) to clear pinned experiment selection
- Enhanced tooltip to identify which experiment each point belongs to

**UI Refinements:**
- Changed default chart metric from objective_score to mean_total_throughput for better visibility
- Commented out View Mode Tabs section (can be re-enabled if needed)
- Improved dropdown sizing and visual consistency
