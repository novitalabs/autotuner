> Enhance the TaskResults.tsx component with metric selection, experiment pinning, and multi-experiment scatter plot comparison

<details>
<summary>Enhanced TaskResults.tsx with advanced visualization and interaction features</summary>

**Experiment Metrics Bar Chart:**
- Added metric selection dropdown to dynamically display different metrics (objective_score, mean_total_throughput, etc.)
- Implemented click-to-pin functionality for individual experiments
- Color-coded bars: Green (best experiment), Purple (pinned experiment), Blue (normal)
- Experiment labels show ⭐ for best and 📌 for pinned indicators
- Metric dropdown limited to max-width of 160px for UI consistency

**Performance Metrics - Sub-Rounds Scatter Chart:**
- Refactored to simultaneously display data from three experiments:
  - Best experiment (green dots) - automatically highlighted
  - Hovered experiment (blue dots) - dynamically switches when hovering bar chart
  - Pinned experiment (purple dots) - user-selected via click-to-pin
- Added pinnedExperimentData useMemo hook for efficient data management
- Updated legend to show all active experiments with round counts
- Implemented unpin button (×) to clear pinned experiment selection
- Enhanced tooltip to identify which experiment each point belongs to

**UI Refinements:**
- Changed default chart metric from objective_score to mean_total_throughput for better visibility
- Commented out View Mode Tabs section (can be re-enabled if needed)
- Improved dropdown sizing and visual consistency

File modified: `frontend/src/components/TaskResults.tsx`

> Add Markdown rendering for agent output with support for tables, code blocks, and copy functionality. Also rename the project from "Inference Autotuner" to "Autotuner".

<details>
<summary>Implemented Markdown rendering and project renaming</summary>

**Markdown Rendering Component:**
- Installed `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` packages for full markdown support
- Created `StreamingMarkdown.tsx` component with paragraph-aware streaming
- Preserves tables and code blocks as atomic units (no mid-element streaming)
- Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown: tables, strikethrough, task lists, etc.

**Markdown Styling:**
- Added Tailwind typography plugin for semantic markdown elements
- Applied consistent margins to paragraphs, headings (h1-h4), and lists
- Styled tables with borders, padding, and hover effects
- Code blocks with dark theme and monospace font

**Table and Code Block Headers:**
- Added header bars displaying "Table" and language labels
- Copy button on each header copies original markdown source (not rendered HTML)
- Implemented React Context to pass unrendered markdown to custom components
- Prevents copying corrupted HTML representations

**Copy Button for Assistant Messages:**
- Added copy icon button at bottom of every assistant message
- Appears on hover, copies full message content
- Shows "Copied" confirmation state with brief visual feedback

**Project Renaming (Inference Autotuner → Autotuner):**
- Updated `frontend/public/index.html` title tag
- Updated `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` sidebar branding
- Updated `README.md` and all markdown documentation
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` architecture documentation
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` overview and task descriptions
- Renaming applied consistently across frontend and backend references

Files modified: `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json`, `frontend/src/components/StreamingMarkdown.tsx` (new), `frontend/src/components/IterationBlock.tsx`, `frontend/tailwind.config.js`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
