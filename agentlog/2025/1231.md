## Redis Pub/Sub Sync Verification

Confirmed that Pub/Sub synchronization between Manager and Remote Worker is working correctly after earlier fixes. Task 142 completed successfully with experiment results synced via Redis Pub/Sub from remote worker to manager.

## Worker Deploy/Restore Tool Bug Analysis

Identified and fixed 6 critical bugs in the worker deployment tools:

### Bug 1: Code Not Synced During Restore
- **Issue**: When project already exists, restore skips code sync entirely
- **Impact**: Stale code runs on remote worker
- **Fix**: Added `force_sync` parameter to force code sync even when project exists

### Bug 2: SSH Tunnel Configuration Confusion
- **Issue**: Deploy tool only supports forward tunnel (worker→manager), but actual setup needs reverse tunnel (manager→worker)
- **Impact**: Manager cannot reach Redis on remote worker during initial setup
- **Fix**: Added `setup_reverse_tunnel()` function to create reverse SSH tunnels from Manager to Remote

### Bug 3: PYTHONPATH Issue in start_remote_worker.sh
- **Issue**: Script changes to `cd src` instead of setting PYTHONPATH, causing module imports to fail
- **Impact**: Worker fails to start with import errors
- **Fix**: Changed to `export PYTHONPATH=$PROJECT_PATH` for proper Python path

### Bug 4: Unused ssh_reverse_tunnel Field
- **Issue**: Database schema had unused `ssh_reverse_tunnel` field
- **Impact**: Configuration not persisted or used during deploy
- **Fix**: Added proper use of this field and logic to skip forward tunnel when reverse tunnel is configured

### Bug 5: No Option to Force Code Update
- **Issue**: No mechanism to update code on existing remote projects
- **Impact**: Stuck with stale code after initial deploy
- **Fix**: Added `force_sync` parameter and `USE_REVERSE_TUNNEL` environment flag

### Bug 6: Default Project Path Issues
- **Issue**: Default project path `/opt/inference-autotuner` requires root; no tilde expansion for home directory
- **Impact**: Deploy fails on non-root users; cannot use ~/ paths
- **Fix**: Changed default to `~/.autotuner` with added tilde path expansion for remote deployment

## Implementation Details

### 1. Reverse Tunnel Setup (`setup_reverse_tunnel()`)
```python
# src/web/services/worker_service.py
- Establishes reverse SSH tunnel from remote to manager
- Maps remote:6380 → manager:6379 (Redis access)
- Verifies connection before proceeding
- Enables manager to reach remote Redis even behind NAT/firewall
```

### 2. Force Sync Parameter
- Added `force_sync` parameter to `start_remote_worker()` and related functions
- When enabled, skips the "project exists = skip sync" check
- Ensures code is always current with manager

### 3. PYTHONPATH Fix
- Changed from `cd src` approach to explicit `export PYTHONPATH`
- Worker correctly imports from project root without directory changes

### 4. USE_REVERSE_TUNNEL Flag
- When reverse tunnel is configured, skip forward tunnel setup
- Prevents conflict between tunnel types

## Files Modified
- `src/web/services/worker_service.py` - Added `setup_reverse_tunnel()`, `force_sync` parameter, path expansion
- `scripts/start_remote_worker.sh` - Fixed PYTHONPATH to use `export PYTHONPATH=$PROJECT_PATH`, added `USE_REVERSE_TUNNEL` check
- `src/web/agent/tools/worker_tools.py` - Added `ssh_reverse_tunnel` and `force_sync` parameters to deploy schema

## Testing Verified
- Reverse tunnel setup works: remote:6380 → manager:6379
- Worker deployed successfully to ~/.autotuner path
- Worker connects to Manager's Redis v6.0.16 via reverse tunnel
- `force_sync` properly syncs code even when project exists
- PYTHONPATH correctly set, worker starts without import errors

## Key Changes to Deployment Flow
1. Manager initiates reverse SSH tunnel first (if configured)
2. Verifies tunnel connectivity to remote Redis
3. Creates/updates project at specified path (with tilde expansion)
4. Syncs code (optionally forced via force_sync)
5. Starts worker with USE_REVERSE_TUNNEL flag
6. Worker uses reverse tunnel to reach Manager's Redis instead of forward tunnel
