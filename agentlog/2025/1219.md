## Foldable Experiments List

> Make experiments list in task results collapsible for better UX

<details>
<summary>Implementation</summary>

### Problem

When tasks have many experiments, the experiments list takes up too much vertical space, making it hard to navigate the results view.

### Solution

Added a collapsible/foldable section for the experiments list in TaskResults component:

- Experiments list is now wrapped in a collapsible container
- Default state: collapsed (showing summary only)
- Click to expand and see full experiment details
- Reduces visual clutter for tasks with many experiments

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/TaskResults.tsx` (+19 lines)
  - Added state for collapse/expand toggle
  - Wrapped experiments list in collapsible section
  - Added expand/collapse button with visual indicator
